<p class="mb-3">Listed in this questionnare are a number of difficult or stressful things that sometimes happen to people. For each
event check one or more of the response options to indicate that: (a) it happened to you personally; (b) you witnessed
it happen to someone else; (c) you learned about it happening to a close family member or close friend; (d) you were
exposed to it as part of your job (for example, paramedic, police, military, or other first responder); (e) you’re not sure if
it fits; or (f) it doesn’t apply to you.</p>
<p>Be sure to consider your entire life (growing up as well as adulthood) as you go through the list of events.</p>
